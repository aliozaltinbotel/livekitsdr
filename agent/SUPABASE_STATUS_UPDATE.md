# Supabase Integration Status Update

## Current Status (Based on Latest Test)

### ✅ Working:
1. **Session Creation** - Sessions are being created successfully
2. **User Speech Capture** - User transcriptions are being logged via `user_input_transcribed` event
3. **Demo Scheduling** - Successfully updates session with demo details
4. **Room ID Fix** - Calendar tool now correctly identifies the room ID
5. **Supabase Updates** - Updates are working (demo scheduling was successfully saved)

### ⚠️ Partially Working:
1. **Name Extraction** - Updated logic to be more flexible, but needs testing
2. **Email Extraction** - Added support for spoken format ("at" → "@", "dot" → ".")

### ❌ Not Working:
1. **Agent Speech Capture** - Agent messages are not being logged
2. **Conversation History Monitor** - Not finding the chat context to monitor

## Latest Code Updates:

### 1. Improved Name Extraction
- Now works even without agent context
- Detects single-word responses that look like names
- More flexible pattern matching

### 2. Enhanced Email Detection
- Handles spoken format: "john at example dot com"
- Converts to proper email format

### 3. Better Conversation Monitor
- Added debugging to understand why it's not working
- Tries multiple methods to access conversation history
- Logs attempts to help diagnose issues

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy these updates** and test again
2. **Check logs** for:
   - "Conversation monitor running"
   - "Found chat_ctx.messages" or similar
   - "Extracted name:" logs
   - "Extracted email:" logs

3. **Alternative Approach for Agent Messages**:
   If conversation history doesn't work, we could:
   - Hook into the TTS system to capture what's being spoken
   - Use the LLM response before it goes to TTS
   - Monitor the agent state changes more deeply

## Test Script:
When testing, say:
1. "Yes" (to initial question)
2. "Ali" (when asked for name)
3. "Plus nine zero five three two one two three four five six" (phone)
4. "ali at gmail dot com" (email in spoken format)
5. Select a demo time

## SQL to Verify:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sessions 
WHERE session_id LIKE 'voice_assistant_room_%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

SELECT role, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM conversations 
WHERE session_id = (
    SELECT session_id FROM sessions 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
) 
GROUP BY role;
```
