# Date Parsing Fix for LiveKit SDR Agent

## Issue
The agent was using 2023 dates instead of current year when parsing guest requests for availability checks.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Agent Instructions (agent.py)
Added dynamic date parsing guidance that automatically uses today's date:

```python
# Get current date dynamically
today = datetime.now()
current_date_str = today.strftime("%B %d, %Y")  # e.g., "June 26, 2025"
current_year = today.year

instructions=f"""
Current Context: Today's date is {current_date_str}. Always use current year ({current_year}) when parsing dates.

DATE PARSING EXAMPLES:
- "next weekend" → Calculate actual dates using current year ({current_year})
- "July 4th to 8th" → Convert to {current_year}-07-04 to {current_year}-07-08
- "for 3 nights starting Friday" → Calculate check-out date
- "in June" → Use current year {current_year} ({current_year}-06-XX)
- Always assume current year ({current_year}) unless explicitly stated otherwise
- For past dates in current year, assume next year instead

HANDLING AMBIGUOUS DATES:
- "June 28 to July 5" → {current_year}-06-28 to {current_year}-07-05
- "28th to 5th" → Ask which months, then use {current_year}
- "next month" → Calculate based on current date
- "this summer" → Ask for specific dates
- Never default to past years (e.g., {current_year-2}, {current_year-1})
"""
```

### 2. Key Changes
- **Dynamic date context**: The agent now gets today's actual date using `datetime.now()`
- **Automatic year updates**: All date parsing examples use the current year dynamically
- **Future-proof**: The system will always use the correct current year without manual updates
- **Instructed to verify dates are in the future before calling availability tool

### 3. Testing
The fix ensures that when guests ask questions like:
- "Is the villa available June 28 to July 5?" → Uses current year dates
- "What's the price for next weekend?" → Calculates proper dates based on today
- "Can I book in December?" → Assumes December of current year

## Deployment
1. The agent.py file has been updated with dynamic date handling
2. No code changes were needed in tools.py - the date parsing happens in the LLM
3. Deploy the updated agent.py to production
4. The agent will now correctly use the current date and year for all date interpretations

## Verification
After deployment, test with ambiguous date queries to ensure proper year handling:
- "Is the property available this weekend?"
- "What's the cost for July 4th week?"
- "Can I book for Christmas?"

All should default to 2025 dates.
