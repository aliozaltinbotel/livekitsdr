# Latest Supabase Integration Fixes

## Test Results from voice_assistant_room_7890

### What Happened:
1. **Name Extraction Issue**: "Yes" was incorrectly extracted as the user's name
2. **Name Correction Missed**: User said "No, this is ali" but it wasn't captured
3. **No Agent Messages**: Conversation history monitor found no messages
4. **Demo Scheduling**: ✅ Worked correctly

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Smarter Name Extraction
```python
# Added exclusion list for common words
exclude_words = ['yes', 'no', 'okay', 'sure', 'correct', 'right', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'please', 'thanks']
```

### 2. Name Correction Detection
Now detects phrases like:
- "My name is Ali"
- "This is Ali" 
- "I am Ali"
- "I'm Ali"
- "Call me Ali"

### 3. Initial Agent Message Capture
- Stores the initial greeting as the first agent message
- Ensures `last_agent_message` has context for name detection

## SQL Query to Run:
```sql
-- Check the latest session
SELECT 
    session_id,
    user_name,
    user_email,
    user_phone,
    demo_scheduled,
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM sessions
WHERE session_id = 'voice_assistant_room_7890';

-- Check conversation messages
SELECT 
    role,
    COUNT(*) as message_count
FROM conversations
WHERE session_id = 'voice_assistant_room_7890'
GROUP BY role;

-- See actual messages
SELECT 
    role,
    LEFT(message, 50) as message_preview,
    timestamp
FROM conversations
WHERE session_id = 'voice_assistant_room_7890'
ORDER BY timestamp
LIMIT 10;
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment:
1. ✅ Won't extract "Yes" as a name
2. ✅ Will capture "Ali" from "this is Ali"
3. ✅ Initial greeting will be logged as agent message
4. ✅ Better context for name detection

## Still Pending:
- Agent conversation history monitoring (needs different approach)
- Phone number extraction (not tested yet)
- Email extraction (not tested yet)
