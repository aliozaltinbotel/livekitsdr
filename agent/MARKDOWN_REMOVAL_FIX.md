# Markdown Formatting Removal for Voice Agent

## Issue
The voice agent was reading markdown formatting characters aloud during conversations (e.g., "asterisk asterisk bold text asterisk asterisk", "hashtag header", etc.)

## Solution Implemented

### Removed All Markdown Formatting:

1. **Headers** - Removed `#`, `##`, `###` etc.
2. **Bold/Italic** - Removed `**text**` and `*text*`
3. **Lists** - Converted numbered lists from `1. item` to `First: item` or plain text
4. **Dividers** - Removed `====` and `----` lines
5. **Special Characters** - Removed arrows `→` and bullets `•`
6. **Code Blocks** - Removed backticks `` ` ``

### Key Changes:

#### Before:
```

1. Always speak in a friendly tone

→ "Let me check that for you..."
```

AVAILABILITY AND PRICING
Guest asks Is property available?

```

### Benefits:
- Agent now speaks naturally without mentioning formatting characters
- Instructions remain clear and organized using plain text structure
- Voice conversations flow more smoothly without interruptions

### Testing:
Created `verify_no_markdown.py` script to ensure all markdown formatting has been removed from agent instructions.

## Deployment
Deploy the updated agent.py to production. The agent will now speak naturally without reading any markdown formatting characters.
